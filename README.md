# UserManager
This script extend User Model in Django. Add edit, delete, view the user.
To extend User in Django there are many ways.
I used the following methods.

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser


class User(AbstractUser):	
	randomId= models.IntegerField()  
	birthday = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
	
  
In this way I extend the user, when use this method, you should create models.py at first after create the project.

To run this app in terminal or console widnow
go to the this app script directory run following command

python manage.py runserver

The log in redirect page is localhost:8000/feeds/
